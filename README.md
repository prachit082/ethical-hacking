## Introduction✓✓
~Who Is An Ethical Hacker?


An ethical hacker is a computer network specialist who deals with the security posture of an organization. 
His job involves eliciting security flaws in the organization he is working for by testing all aspects of the system and its services for any sort of vulnerabilities. 
The key point to notice is that all this is done with the permission of the owners of the organization and without any malicious intent. 
An ethical hacker is also known as a white hat hacker and is the stark opposite of a black hat hacker, a.k.a crackers who hack with the sole purpose of bringing about some sort of disruption, or chaos from the vulnerabilities they find. 



### Key Concepts Of Ethical Hacking✓✓
~Ethical Hackers Should Follow 4 Key Protocol Concepts:


1-Stay legal: Obtain proper approval before accessing and performing a security assessment.

2-Define the scope: Determine the scope of the assessment so that the ethical hacker’s work remains legal and within the organization’s approved boundaries.

3-Report vulnerabilities: Notify the organization of all vulnerabilities discovered during the assessment. 
Provide remediation advice for resolving these vulnerabilities.

4-Respect data sensitivity: Depending on the data sensitivity, ethical hackers may have to agree to a non-disclosure agreement, in addition to other terms and conditions required by the assessed organization.

### Limitations Of Ethical Hacking✓✓
~There Are 3 Major Limitations:

1- Limited Scope:

2- Resource Constraints:
Malicious hackers don’t have time constraints that ethical hackers often face. 
Computing power and budget are additional constraints of ethical hackers.

3- Restricted Methods:
Some organizations ask experts to avoid test cases that lead the servers to crash (e.g., Denial of Service (DoS) attacks).
