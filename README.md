## Introduction
Who Is An Ethical Hacker?


An ethical hacker is a computer network specialist who deals with the security posture of an organization. 
His job involves eliciting security flaws in the organization he is working for by testing all aspects of the system and its services for any sort of vulnerabilities. 
The key point to notice is that all this is done with the permission of the owners of the organization and without any malicious intent. 
An ethical hacker is also known as a white hat hacker and is the stark opposite of a black hat hacker, a.k.a crackers who hack with the sole purpose of bringing about some sort of disruption, or chaos from the vulnerabilities they find.
